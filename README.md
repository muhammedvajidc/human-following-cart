# Human Following Cart 🚶‍♂️🛒

    Human Following Cart is an intelligent robotic system designed to autonomously follow a human user while carrying loads such as shopping items or materials. This project combines embedded systems, sensor technologies, and motor control to create a hands-free load-carrying solution for various real-world applications like shopping malls, warehouses, or personal use.

𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀

✅ Human Detection and Following:
Uses sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR, or vision-based tracking) to continuously detect and follow a target human.

✅ Obstacle Avoidance:
Incorporates distance sensing (using ultrasonic or IR sensors) to avoid collisions with objects.

✅ RFID-Based Billing (Optional Module):
Integrates RFID technology for automatic product detection and billing, useful for shopping cart applications.

✅ Load Carrying Capability:
Can carry goods or shopping items while autonomously following the user.
